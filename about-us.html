Autotronics Performance Garage was founded with humble beginnings as an entry level garage in the Year 2011 as a backyard workshop aimed to service and maintain vehicles for family and friends of the Rayat family. It was a low cost and low risk outfit designed to help friends and family cut down costs on maintaining their vehicles and a change to venture into the field of chasing our passion to build custom cars. In two years time before we knew we were getting so much positive exposure for such a small company. We started working for a vast market from regular maintenance to high performance and luxury car maintenance. In the year 2013 we expanded and moved into a relatively small workshop in Industrial Area and spent a year there getting our toes dipped into the corporate world.

<br><br>  
At the end of 2014 we knew we were no longer a small hobbyist workshop and we needed to move into a full size functional professional workshop and thus we leased a 4500sqft warehouse along Enterprise Road. Here we began work in earnest and got established as professionals in the field, professionals who have built show cars, off road cars, street cars and then we started our most important wing, the fleet management section. 

<br><br>  
In the beginning of 2011, we were happily forced to expand because of the success with fleet management into a different premises which was 7500sqft. It was a modern, safe and secure warehouse situated in Embakasi on the old Airport Road within the G4S compound. Here we offered the best services no matter what kind of vehicle. As much as with the Grace of the Almighty we expanded as a company we have never forgotten our roots which were based on the foundations of personalised service and an environment where a client is not shunned away but welcomed by our team of mechanics,bodyshop professionals, wheel technicians and administration staff. We want to establish a relationship with our clients knowing that they are not only a monetary input to our outfit but a vital structural support in our goal to be leaders in our field. 

<br><br>  
More recently in early 2022 we had the opportunity to expand even further and moved to an even bigger facility located in the prestigious Upperhill area of Nairobi where we now offer a whole new array of services including an in-house tyre centre and basic engineering facilities.

<br><br>  
Today we boast to be a Motorists Association of Kenya CLASS A certified garage. A garage that has been featured on numerous local TV and radio stations and magazines. We want to give you a reason to be proud to be associated with us as much as we would be grateful to be associated with your firm.
