If your hoses look swollen or soft that could be an indicator that they need to be replaced. However, hoses can deteriorate on the inside and if this happens there is no visual evidence that the hose needs to be changed.                   </p>

- Make sure the shop has your contact information readily available, so that you can be reached as soon as possible. </p>

First thing you should do is turn off your AC if you have it on and find a safe place to pull your car off the road.  Do NOT attempt to remove the radiator cap or check any of the hoses.  It is very dangerous to do this under these conditions, and you are likely to get severely burned.  A car that has over heated can cause massive damage, very quickly.  This is why it is important to pull off the road as soon as you safely can and have your vehicle towed to an autoservice shop for an inspection.
